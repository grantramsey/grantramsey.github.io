# About the lab

Philosophy is traditionally an individualistic pursuit driven by armchair reflections. Although there is certainly a place for this kind of philosophy, I feel that philosophy of biology is best approached through collaborative efforts within philosophy and across the disciplinary divides. I thus draw from the sciences and promote a “lab” culture in my students and postdocs by encouraging both individual-level pursuits, but also larger, lab-level collaborative pursuits. One example of such collaborative efforts is [evoText,](http://www.evotext.org/) a powerful evolutionary text analysis tool that we are currently building. An extension of the Ramsey Lab is the Evolution Working Group (EWG), which has collaboratively published a series of book reviews (see [Research](/research.html) for a list of EWG publications).

I have won awards for my teaching and for my research ([see my CV](/ramsey-cv.pdf)) and am passionate about both. I am always on the lookout for talented undergrads wishing to pursue a PhD in the philosophy of biology and for graduate students interested in a postdoc position in my lab. My lab is in the process of relocating to the [Institute of Philosophy](http://hiw.kuleuven.be/eng) at [KU Leuven](http://www.kuleuven.be/english). If you are interested in joining my lab as a doctoral student or postdoc, please send me an email at <grant@theramseylab.org>. 


# Lab placement

**Michael Deem**: In 2015 Michael accepted a tenure track job at [Indiana State University](http://cms.indstate.edu) where he will be Assistant Professor of Philosophy and an affiliated faculty member in [The Center for Genomic Advocacy](http://www.unboundedpossibilities.com/the-center-for-genomic-advocacy.aspx). He will be on leave from ISU his first year while he spends the year as Pediatric Bioethics and Genomics Postdoctoral Fellow at [Children's Mercy Hospitals and Clinics](http://www.childrensmercy.org). See his Lab research on the [people tab](http://www.theramseylab.org/people) or at [his website](http://michaeljdeem.weebly.com).

**Charles Pence**: Charles is the first Ramsey Lab alumnus. During his time at Notre Dame he helped develop [the evoText project](http://www.evotext.org) and worked extensively on conceptual issues at the foundation of evolutionary theory. In 2014 he defended his disertation, _Chance in Evolutionary Theory: Fitness, Selection, and Genetic Drift in Philosophical and Historical Perspective_, and accepted a tenure track job at [LSU's](http://www.lsu.edu) [Department of Philosophy and Religious Studies](http://uiswcmsweb.prod.lsu.edu/hss/prs/). See his Lab research on the [people tab](http://www.theramseylab.org/people) or at [his website](http://www.charlespence.net).

**Anne Siebels Peterson**: Anne's dissertation was advised by [Michael Loux](http://philosophy.nd.edu/people/michael-loux/) but she teamed up with the  Ramsey Lab to work on philosophy of biology, especially conceptual issues related to homology. In 2014 she accepted a tenure track job at [The Department of Philosophy](http://philosophy.utah.edu) at the [University of Utah](http://www.utah.edu). See her Lab research on the [people tab](http://www.theramseylab.org/people).

# About me

I grew up in the wilds of northern California, where I developed a deep appreciation for nature and a love of science. I attended college at [The Evergreen State College,](http://www.evergreen.edu/) spending much time in the field studying rocks, plants, and insects. At Evergreen I developed a passion for interdisciplinary studies and discovered the field of philosophy of biology. I then pursued graduate school in philosophy of biology at [Duke University,](http://www.duke.edu) studying under [Robert Brandon](https://fds.duke.edu/db/aas/Philosophy/rbrandon) and [Alex Rosenberg.](http://people.duke.edu/~alexrose/) Upon completing my PhD from Duke, I took a job at the [University of Notre Dame](http://www.nd.edu/) where until June 2015 I held an Assistant Professorship in the [Department of Philosophy](http://philosophy.nd.edu/) and was faculty in the [Program in History and Philosophy of Science](http://reilly.nd.edu/history-and-philosophy-of-science/) and a Reilly Fellow at the [Reilly Center for Science, Technology, and Values.](http://reilly.nd.edu) Beginning August 2015 I will be a fellow at the [National Humanities Center](http://nationalhumanitiescenter.org). My new permanent academic home (beginning July 2016) is the [Institute of Philosophy](http://hiw.kuleuven.be/eng) at [KU Leuven](http://www.kuleuven.be/english), where I hold a BOFZAP Research Professor postion. 


# Photography

I am passionate about photography. I regularly teach a seminar on photographic theory and, when I get a chance, pursue photographic projects of my own. To see some of my photography, [visit my photography website.](http://www.grantramsey.com/)


# About the rhino illustration

The rhinoceros on the [Home page](/) was drawn in 1510 by [Albrecht Dürer.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albrecht_D%C3%BCrer) I love this illustration for several reasons in addition to its manifest beauty. As a philosopher of biology I find it interesting that it was illustrated in the absence of any first-hand experience with (or photographs of) real rhinos. Instead, it is drawn from a description and sketch of a rhino. It is thus a concept-driven illustration, and it is fascinating to see which details  he got right and which are far from reality. I also like that it is an illustration of [_Rhinoceros unicornus,_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Rhinoceros) the Asian one-horned rhino. Back in 2000, I was attacked by a member of this species while trekking through the [Royal Chitwan National Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chitwan_National_Park) in southern Nepal—I therefore have great respect for these animals.
