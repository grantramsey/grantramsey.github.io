# About the Lab

Philosophy is traditionally an individualistic pursuit driven by armchair reflections. Although there is certainly a place for this kind of philosophy, I feel that philosophy of biology is best approached through collaborative efforts within philosophy and across the disciplinary divides. I thus draw from the sciences and promote a “lab” culture in my students by encouraging both individual-level pursuits, but also larger, lab-level collaborative pursuits. One example of such collaborative efforts is evoText <www.evotext.org>, a powerful evolutionary text analysis tool that we are currently building. An extension of the Ramsey Lab is the Evolution Working Group (EWG), which has collaboratively published a series of book reviews (see [Research](/research.html) for a list of EWG publications).

I am always on the lookout for talented undergrads wishing to pursue a PhD in the philosophy of biology. If you are interested in joining my lab, please send me an email at grant.ramsey@nd.edu. My mailing address is: 100 Malloy Hall; Department of Philosophy; University of Notre Dame; Notre Dame, IN 46556.


# About me

I grew up in the wilds of northern California, where I developed a deep appreciation for nature and a love of science. I attended college at [The Evergreen State College,](http://www.evergreen.edu/) spending much time in the field studying rocks, plants, and insects. At Evergreen I developed a passion for interdisciplinary studies and discovered the field of philosophy of biology. I then pursued graduate school in philosophy of biology at [Duke University,](http://www.duke.edu) studying under [Robert Brandon](https://fds.duke.edu/db/aas/Philosophy/rbrandon) and [Alex Rosenberg.](http://people.duke.edu/~alexrose/) Upon completing my PhD from Duke, I took a job at the [University of Notre Dame.](http://www.nd.edu/) I now hold an Assistant Professorship in the [Department of Philosophy](http://philosophy.nd.edu/) and am also faculty in the [Program in History and Philosophy of Science.](reilly.nd.edu/history-and-philosophy-of-science/)


# Photography

I am passionate about photography. I regularly teach a seminar on photographic theory and, when I get a chance, pursue photographic projects of my own. To see some of my photography, visit my photography website, <www.grantramsey.com>.


# About the Rhino illustration

The rhinoceros on the [Home page](/) was drawn in 1510 by [Albrecht Dürer.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albrecht_D%C3%BCrer) I love this illustration for several reasons in addition to its manifest beauty. As a philosopher of biology I find it interesting that it was illustrated in the absence of any first-hand experience with (or photographs of) real rhinos. Instead, it is drawn from a description and sketch of a rhino. It is thus a concept-driven illustration, and it is fascinating to see which details  he got right and which are far from reality. I also like that it is an illustration of [_Rhinoceros unicornus,_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Rhinoceros) the Asian one-horned rhino. Back in 2000, I was attacked by a member of this species while trekking through the [Royal Chitwan National Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chitwan_National_Park) in southern Nepal—I therefore have great respect for these animals.
