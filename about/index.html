      <p>Philosophy is traditionally an individualistic pursuit driven by armchair reflections. Although there is certainly a place for this kind of philosophy, I feel that philosophy of biology is best approached through collaborative efforts within philosophy and across the disciplinary divides. I thus draw from the sciences and promote a “lab” culture in my students by encouraging both individual-level pursuits, but also larger, lab-level collaborative pursuits. One example of such collaborative efforts is <a href="http://www.evotext.org/">evoText,</a> a powerful evolutionary text analysis tool that we are currently building. An extension of the Ramsey Lab is the Evolution Working Group (EWG), which has collaboratively published a series of book reviews (see <a href="/research/">Research</a> for a list of EWG publications).</p>
      
      <p>I am always on the lookout for talented undergrads wishing to pursue a PhD in the philosophy of biology. If you are interested in joining my lab, please send me an email at <a href="&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#103;&#114;&#097;&#110;&#116;&#064;&#116;&#104;&#101;&#114;&#097;&#109;&#115;&#101;&#121;&#108;&#097;&#098;&#046;&#111;&#114;&#103;">&#103;&#114;&#097;&#110;&#116;&#064;&#116;&#104;&#101;&#114;&#097;&#109;&#115;&#101;&#121;&#108;&#097;&#098;&#046;&#111;&#114;&#103;</a>.

      <h1 id="about-me">About me</h1>
      
      <p>I grew up in the wilds of northern California, where I developed a deep appreciation for nature and a love of science. I attended college at <a href="http://www.evergreen.edu/">The Evergreen State College,</a> spending much time in the field studying rocks, plants, and insects. At Evergreen I developed a passion for interdisciplinary studies and discovered the field of philosophy of biology. I then pursued graduate school in philosophy of biology at <a href="http://www.duke.edu">Duke University,</a> studying under <a href="https://fds.duke.edu/db/aas/Philosophy/rbrandon">Robert Brandon</a> and <a href="http://people.duke.edu/~alexrose/">Alex Rosenberg.</a> Upon completing my PhD from Duke, I took a job at the <a href="http://www.nd.edu/">University of Notre Dame.</a> I now hold an Assistant Professorship in the <a href="http://philosophy.nd.edu/">Department of Philosophy</a> and am also faculty in the <a href="reilly.nd.edu/history-and-philosophy-of-science/">Program in History and Philosophy of Science.</a></p>
      
      <h1 id="photography">Photography</h1>
      
      <p>I am passionate about photography. I regularly teach a seminar on photographic theory and, when I get a chance, pursue photographic projects of my own. To see some of my photography, <a href="http://www.grantramsey.com/">visit my photography website.</a></p>
      
      <h1 id="about-the-rhino-illustration">About the rhino illustration</h1>
      
      <p>The rhinoceros on the <a href="/">Home page</a> was drawn in 1510 by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albrecht_D%C3%BCrer">Albrecht Dürer.</a> I love this illustration for several reasons in addition to its manifest beauty. As a philosopher of biology I find it interesting that it was illustrated in the absence of any first-hand experience with (or photographs of) real rhinos. Instead, it is drawn from a description and sketch of a rhino. It is thus a concept-driven illustration, and it is fascinating to see which details  he got right and which are far from reality. I also like that it is an illustration of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Rhinoceros"><em>Rhinoceros unicornus,</em></a> the Asian one-horned rhino. Back in 2000, I was attacked by a member of this species while trekking through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chitwan_National_Park">Royal Chitwan National Park</a> in southern Nepal—I therefore have great respect for these animals.</p>
